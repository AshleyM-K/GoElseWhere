# Go Elsewhere

Sophomore project Fall 2020 where myself (Scrum Master & Developer) and 5 other student developers utilized the Scrum lifecycle to create a simple travel based website.  The other students were IT Majors while myself in Computer Science, our skills were all very diverse. When assigning tasks I kept this in mind, and if they were unsure on how to complete a task I helped out with resources and collaboration. We were all very please with the overall simple yet effective design.
